# Roadmap

This document outlines the technical roadmap and vision for HatMax. It provides a high-level view of planned development phases and major milestones.

## Vision

HatMax aims to be the most productive and reliable code generator for Go services, emphasizing:
- **Quality First**: Generated code should be production-ready with comprehensive tests
- **Pattern-Driven**: Focus on proven architectural patterns (DDD, CQRS, Event Sourcing)
- **Developer Experience**: Minimize boilerplate, maximize productivity
- **Multi-Database**: First-class support for SQL and NoSQL databases

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Q4 2024 - Q1 2025) âœ…
**Status: Completed**

- [x] Basic model and repository generation
- [x] SQLite and MongoDB support  
- [x] Configuration-driven generation
- [x] Service scaffolding

### Phase 2: Quality & Testing (Q1 2025 - Current) ðŸš§
**Status: In Progress**

- [x] Aggregate repository pattern
- [x] Table-based test generation for SQLite (72.1% coverage)
- [ ] MongoDB test generation
- [ ] Generator self-testing
- [ ] Documentation structure

**Current Focus**: Completing comprehensive test generation across all database types.

### Phase 3: Advanced Patterns (Q2 2025) ðŸ”®
**Status: Planned**

- [ ] Event sourcing patterns
- [ ] CQRS implementation
- [ ] Advanced aggregate relationships
- [ ] Migration management

- **Current**: ~50% faster (estimated)

### Code Quality
- **Target**: 95%+ test coverage in generated code
- **Measure**: Automated coverage reporting
- **Current**: 72.1% (SQLite repositories only)

### Reliability
- **Target**: Zero critical bugs in generated code
- **Measure**: Bug reports and regression tests
- **Current**: Tracking begins with Phase 2 completion

### Adoption
- **Target**: 100+ active users by end of 2025
- **Measure**: GitHub stars, downloads, community engagement
- **Current**: Early development phase

## Technology Evolution

### Current Stack
- Go 1.21+ for generator
