# HatMax

`HatMax` is a Go-based monorepo generator. It's designed to build a monorepo of microservices from a single `hatmax.yml` definition file.

## How it Works

The generator parses the `hatmax.yml` file to understand the desired services, models, and APIs. It then scaffolds the directory structure and will eventually generate the boilerplate code for each service.
